commands to set up conda environment and install relevant packages:

conda create --name ccLoops
conda activate ccLoops

conda install jupyter notebook
conda install -c pytorch ignite
conda install -c conda-forge sacred
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
conda install -c conda-forge tqdm

If using a Python version later than 3.7, you may potentially get an error with the |Sacred package. This can be manually fixed by changing the utils.py file in the sacred package:
an example path for this file is

anaconda3/envs/ccLoops/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sacred/utils.py

In this file change collections.Mapping -> collections.abc.Mapping
